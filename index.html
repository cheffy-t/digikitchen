  <p>there is nothing here yet; but hold on! I need to lay the foundation</p>
  <p>planned features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>gallery featuring photos of food and drinks i make</li>
    <ul><li>And of me, doing culinary things in the wild?</li></ul>
    <li>Some recipes of my own</li>
  </ul>
    <p>I have to figure out the ideal layout for this 'website', a mix between sleek professionalism and individuality.
    <br>
    And such, this will be a WIP for a good while.</p>
